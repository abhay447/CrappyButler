So after getting the pcm data we work upon converting it in a more interpretable form. Raw pcm data looks bizzare and senseless to at first site but 
when we consider the fact the it is just a sequence short ints writeen in Little/Big Endian binary format then it all starts to make sense. Depending 
on the Endian format used we write a simple cpp program to read each pcm file two bytes at a time and convert the observed number to a decimal short 
integer.
This way we end up with a new file consisting of amplitude values of the signal at various instances. Now, from the initial recording configuartion 
one can easily get the sampling frequency, number of channels etc. So you can easily have a list of time instances using the sampling frequency. We 
can denote the amplitude value at a particular instance of time as A(t), where
t = 0 + I/F
Here,
I is the index of the sample in the amplitude array
and F is the sampling frequency

Common sampling frequencies for sounds are 8000hz,22050hz,44100hz etc.. but I was crazier than usual that fateful night so I chose 22100 Hz.
P.S.- I wasn't drunk while chosing the frequency, I DON'T DRINK. I was just.. ummm.. crazier than usual. :P

So now that I had a set amplitude signal at different instances of time I decided to plot an amplitude vs time graph(used gnuplot for its simplicity).
I observed that the amplitude value stayed in the proximity of A=0 line for most of the time except for times when a word was spoken. For every word spoken the plot had a cluster of amplitude values which were far from the A=0 line stacked together. So I thought it would be better to analyze the part of signal in which the word was spoken and reject all other portions of the signal. This way I wrote a small program for segmentation.
The basic logic that goverened segmentation was:
a) The mean and standard was calculated for the whole signal(say M and SD).
b) A cover_time was selected so as to analyze the whole signal in consecutive frames
c) Caculate the mean and standard deviation for each frame(say fM,fSD).
d) Multiply the SD by a suitable factor(say P).
e) Initially the signal is void so as soon as we encounter a disturbance creation of a new segment is triggered by the rule:
	if (fabs(M)+fabs(SD*P) > fabs(fM)+fabs(fSD))
		pass
	else
		create a sengment
The amplitude data from a segment is recorded seperately into a segments file. This file is sent to the next stage for further evaluation.
